* Two drivers of learning behaviour are natural curiosity and the desire for a reward. But which is better for helping children learn? By Tiffanie Wen, 6th December 2019.

Getting children to learn for the sake of learning rarher than the promise of an A grade or threat of an F. It sounds like a pipe dream, right? Maybe not.

From the time they are toddles, children are naturally interested in exploring their enviornment. From examining a blade of grass to playing with the family pet, toddlers want to know how enerything works, feels and tastes. According to experts, it's not until later they learn to do something - like site quietly at a snake table - in order to gain a reward or avoid a punishment.

These two drivers of behaviour are knowns as intrinsic motivation (natural curiosity) extrinsic motivation (link to reward). But which is better for helping children learn - and can you nuture a joy of learning without handing out rewards?

¡iThe value of natural curiosity¡j 

"Intrinsic motivation starts early. Chuldren are proactive. They are curious by nature," says professor Frederic Guay, an expert in motivation t Laval University in Quebec. "Educators and school system need to nuture this motivation."

Guay and his colleagues conducted a soon-to-be published meta- analysis on intrinsic motivation and student outcomes from primary school to university level, looking at 344 studies and a sample of more than 200,000 children. Student completed a questionnaire designed to measure different types of motivation, and grades were swlf-reported or taken from in particular subjects experienced higher achivment, increased persistence and increased creativity in those areas.

Other research backs up the notion that intrinsically motivated kids are better at learning. One study from Germany found that students aged seven to nine who felt immersed in the stories they read had higher levels of reading comprehension than those who were driven by the desire to compete with other student. Another German study found a reciprocal relationship between intrinsic reading motivaion and reading achievement in students aged eight to 10, but no such relationship when the motivation was extrinsic.

And the bevefits of intrinsic motivation on performance are not limited to kids. One study that examined the motivations of cadets at West Point military academy found that those who were purely intrinsically motivated were more likely to become commissioned officers, extend their service and be selected for early promotions than those who were both intrinsically motivated.

¡iSo why do we give stickers, then?¡j 

Yet despite the evidence on the importance of nuturing intrinsic motivation, a reward culture creeps into the classroom early on. Children get prize like stickers to encourage good behaviour and regular report cards to offically acknowledge achievment.


* Acknowledging one student's good behaviour helps other student do the same - Christine Dewart

One study of teacher's use of rewards from kindergarten to fifth grade found, for example, that all teachers in the study used rewards like praise. Nearly 80% also used tangible rewards on a weekly basis, like tokens to purchase prizes later. Other common forms of reward included class privileges, like deciding an activity or extra time on fun activities.

Christine Dewart, who has taught five-to-six-year-olds in Califorina for nine years, says when she studied child development at university there was an emphasis on the importance of intrinsic motivation and avoiding too many rewards. But in here everyday professional experience, she sees the value of using rewards to manage her class - and has found that "acknowleding one studenrt's good behaviour helps other student do the same."

Dewart cites the case of a student with anxiety and physical aggression issue. "I didn't want to single him out for misbehaving, so I came up with a behaviour plane involving rewards. For every 15 minutes he was able to control himself, he earned one minute of free times to use later. "The 15-minute requirement then became 30 minutes and eventually stretched to an entire lesson in which he was able to stay calm and attaentive-a process jumpstarted by the reward.

¡iCan you boost intrinsic motivation?¡j

If educating children is a complex mix of nuturing their own curiosity and rewarding them for completing less attractives tasks, can we do more to mask the task itself the reward?

Sarah McGeown, a senior lecturer in developmental psychology at the University of Edinburgh, says there are things teachers and parents can do th boost a child's intrinsic motivation. One example is recreational reading, of which intrinsic reading motivation is a predictor.

She says finding books that are at the right reading level is important, as is encouraging student to identify as readers even of they choose comic books or magazines over novels. "It's about broadening the conceptualisation of what it means to be a reader so more children and adolescents can self-identify as readers," she says. " Helping children find the geners or authors that they enjouy is really important."

Guay believes it is essential to support kids in a way that makes them feel they have chioces and are doing things of their own free will. "Rather than focusing on rewards, focus on the quality of relationshiop with the students," he says, "[That} means listening to children and even acknowledging negative feeling, which are normal."

* Studies have shown that for older student, extrinsic motivators can boost performanc

He suggests finding time to address negative feelings toward an activity and explain why it is valuable even if it's not particularly fun. "Students who find learning important, even if they don't enjoy it will bring about the same kinds of positive outcomes as you see with those with high intrinsic motivation."

¡iDoes feedback trump grades?¡j

But what does this all mean for grades, perhaps the most obvious extrinsic motivator for school learners? Both Guay and McGeown say there should be less focus on grades and more on the effort it took durning the process itself. But some teachers want to go further.

Aaron Blackwelder, a high school English teacher, helped found the Facebook group Teachers Going Gradeless three years ago. From an intial membership of a few hundred, it now has 5,000 members.

He was inspired by a serious of studies in the 1980s in which students aged 10-12 were assigned to receive either grades, grades and feeback, or feedback only. Interest and performance were highest for students who only received feedback, while grades and grades plus feedback undermined their interest and performance, the studies found.

Instead of giving grades, Blackwelder presents students with a list of skills they need to master and opts for a pure feedback model on assignments. Some teachers are leerly of his methods but he believes they are working. While there are always a few kids who don't participate, that number hasn't gone up, while the kids who do participate are improving "astronomically".

"They trust me to offer constructive feedback because my actions are not perceived as punitive," he says. "Student trust one another as there is no competition to earn the most points and earn the highest grade in the class. Rather, student rely on one another's strengths in order to be successful."

Blackwelder, despite his preferred model, is still required to given a grade at the end of term. But Adam Tyner, associate director of research at the Thomans B.Fordham Institute, an education reform think tank, says grades do serve a practical purpose.

"The main benefit of using grades is that it distills performance into a singele value that parents and student should be able to understand. Teachers can include both academic performance outcomes and day-to-day behaviour into students' grades, which means that they can theoretically capture not just whethere the student knows the subject but also 'non-cognitive skill's like how well students cooperate and collaborate."

And the fact that teachers who have adopted a feedback-only model in the classroom still need to report a final grade points to a social reality, that as we grow op and enter the job market extrinsic motivation - probably in the form of salaries - will play a greater role in our lives.

¡iA place for rewardws?¡j

That may partly be why studies have shown that for older students, extrinsic motivators can boost performance.

Tyner points to the National Math and Science Initiative's College Readiness Program in the US, which couples advanced training for high school students with financial incentives for successful students and teachers. "A rigorous evaluation by Northwest University economist Kirabo Jackson found that NMSI programme increases college attendance by 4.2 percentage points while increasig college readiness and longer-term labour force outcomes. Some subgroup effects were jaw-dopping. Hispanic student experienced an 11% gain in earnings when exposed to the NMSI incentive programme."

¡i I'm sceptical for most adolescent schoolwork...there is much student intrinsic motivation we need to worry about undermining - Adam Tyner¡j

Tyner adds that although extrinsic motivators may undermine existing existing high intrinsic motivation, it is not always the case, and kids are not always intrinsically motivated to begin with.

"One point that researchers make is that extrinsic motivators may be dangerous when intrinsic motivation is already really high and a new incentive re-frames the experience as something to get paid for rather than something to do for fun," he says. "I'm sceptical that for most adolescent much student intrinsic motivation we need to worry about undermining."

And both motivators can soupport each other. "There is a myth that intrinsic and extrinsic motivation are part of some kind of zero-sum competition. If an extrinsic motivator can indirectly empower students."

* Did Disney shape how you see the world?

¡iThere's a good chance that some of your beliefs have been influenced by decades of animated movies. By Richard Gray, 1st August 2019.

Do you whistle while you work? Perhaps you prefer to just keep swimming. Or maybe you're trying to fit you phenomenal cosmic powers into an itty, bitty living space.

If any of these phrases are now worming their way out of your consciousness (you're welcome), then it is likely you are a child of Disney, brought up on regular diet of chirpy tales to keep you occupied while your parents grabbed an hour for themselves.

The generation now filling up workplaces were fed a feast of feature-length animations during their formative years like no other before them.

The Little Mermaid came out 30 years ago and less than six months later was released on home video. This was a significant break for Disney, who usually waited several years before releasing movies on VHS. The films that followed through the 1990s - including Beauty and the Beast, then Aladdin, the Lion King, Pocahontas and the first two Tony Story movies - also came out on video around a year after their cinema release.

And then came DVDs. Disney's first animated DVD was a re- release of The Little Mermaid in 1999. DVDs didn't need rewinding and were less susceptible to going wonky after being repeatedly watched. They were the perfect "electronic babysitter".

But has Disney's cocktail of morality, stereotypes and a sprinkling of magic had any lasting lasting impact on this generation of adults who ,once upon a time, devoured these films as children? And could it be influencing how your colleagues behave in the workplace or even your future career?

"Disney is quite pervasive within our modern culture," says Martyn Giffin, an expert on the cultural perception of work and organisation at Durham University in the UK. "Home videos exposed kids over and over again to the ideas in Disney films. If they were doing this from a young age it is bound to have an impact."

At face value, these cartoons are harmless entertainment, but some researchers have raised comcerns about the subliminal lessons Disney's films contain. Perhaps the most common criticism is the way these have portrayed gender, racial and cultural stereotypes in the past. The opening song Arabian Nights in Aladdin, for example, contained the line "where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face" when it was released in 1993. Disney later changed the lyric.

¡iLasting ompact of stereotypes¡j

Some researchers divide the corporation'ds portrayal of women into distinct eras. First came the domestic era, when female characters like Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella were portrayed as homemakers, often cleaning and in need of rescue by a man.

Then came the rebellious, new-age phase of Ariel in The Little Mermaid, Princess Jasmine inAladdin, Pocahontas and Mulan. During this period, Disney's women seemed to gain a more independent streak, strivng to free themselves form the bonds of society. But Ariel also sacrifices her voice in order to be with man she loves.

"The symbolism here is powerful," wrote Mia Adessa Towbein and her colleagues at the family studies department of Colorado State University in one study. "To win the love of the prince, she most forfeit her thoughts and intellect, her independence and identity."

Although the story was originallu written by Hams Christian Andersen, the researchers say it provides an apt metaphor for many of Disney's heroines - "no one listens to their words".

The Little Mermaid and the fives subsequent fioms also show another trend - the female characters start to sperk less. Despite being the title characters, women speak just 32% of the time in The Little Mermaid, while they have just 24% of lines in Pocahontas and 23% in Mulan, In Aladdin, female characters have just 10% the dialogue.

Carmen Fought and Karen Eisenhauer, the linguists at North Carolina State University whose analysis produced these figures, also found male characters in the same films tended to boss the female characters around far more than vice versa. When the women did so, they were more polite than the men. Others have suggested levels of uncertainty in the dialogue of female characeters have also increased.

For critics, this sends a strong message to young children that reinforces many long- standing gender stereotypes. And there is some evidence it could leave a lasting impression.

---------------------------------
108/12/11 Wed.

A study by family life researcher Sarash Coyne at Brigham Young University - inspired by concerns about her daughter's own consumption of Disney - found that engagemenyt with Disney princesses in young girls around two years old was associated with Disney princesses in young girls around two years old was associated Disney princesses in young girls around two years old was associated with greater female fender-stereotype behavious and lower body self-esteem a year later.

¡iDemonising the mentally ill¡j

Disney has also faced criticism over treatment of mental health - 85% of Disney's 34 animated featyres released before 2004 contained references to mental illness, often in ways that aimed to denigrate or set apart characters, according to psychology researchers at the University of Calgary. They warned it could have "implications  for child viewers in terms of their potentially learning prejudicial attitudes" against people perceived as having mental health problems.

The same research team also warned that the high prevalence of referevces to evil in Disney's films could also lead children to learn to "demonies people who engage in perceived 'bad' behaviours" of they watch the films repeatedly.

It is something Fred Zimmerman, a behavioural economist at the University of California, Los Angeles, agrees could be contributing to wider societal problems today.

"Disney films almost always present a battle between Good and Evil," he says. "ONe can't help but wonder of this Disnified understanding of the world as a struggle between the good guys and bad guys is a piece of today's problems of political polarisation and social exclusion."

¡iThe hidden upside¡j

But there are many potential positive effects from Disney's films too. ONe study showed that watching Disney characters help one another - a common thread - inspired children to help their own friends. 

Another study by Coyne revealed that Disney films are rich in so called "prosocial" behaviour, such as sharing, helping others, or offering compliments or encouragement. She and her colleagues fount that Disney's films contain an average of one act of prosocial behavious every minute - about seven times the level found in other children's television programming in the US.

Griffin believe that the messages learned by children at a young age from films can be carried into the workplace and that there is a good chance that someone sitting near you in the office has some of their beliefs shaped by Disney.

He has studied how work is portrayed in Disney films and says it may have contributed to the reluctance amomg the younger workforce to join traditional workplaces. Millennials demand far more flexibility from employears than previous generations, are more willing to change jobs and companies and often prefer self-employment to the constraints of full-time contracts.

"In the early films, work was always portrayed as this horrible bad thinh," says Griffin. "You had characters who often separated from their parents and punished in this world of work, like Snow White filling up the wash bucket and slaving away in the house and Cinderella subjected to work in the household."

"Disney's response was to say 'whistle while you work' and everythig will be ok as a prince will come along and rescue you," he says. "That went on in the films for years."

"If you think about that [situation] in a modern workplace, it is a dangeruos view to have - if you just carry on being exploited because you think everything is going to turn out to be okay."

Managers - think about the ugly stepsisters in Cinderella for example - are also typically portrayed as manipulative and horrible.

It might also explain some of the dissatisfaction thar millennials who were children during the late 1990s habe with work, he says.

Disney itself did not respond to repeated BBC requests for an interview or a comment for this article. But in Disney's recent films many researchers have noticed a marked change. Giffin, for example, says carrer are portrayed more positively and as something to aspire to.

"Zootopia is great example of work in Disney films," says Griffin. "There ie a bunny rabbit who wants to be a police officer and she gets laughed at but throughout the films she sets out to prove herself. The newest films also have this idea of bringing your friends closer to you to help change your identity and your workplace. That's a really positive message."

The female characters in Frozen, Brave and Moana also represent a new, independent and free-spirited era of Disney. They are strong and in control of their own lives and no longer need male characters to save the day. But while Brave and Moana are seen as truly breaking the Disney princess mould, opinion is somewhat divided over Frozen's heroines.

"The company is attempting to keep up with the times with reference to gender equality and representation," says Ingvild Kvale Sorenssen, who studies children's relationships with Disney at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. "How this influences [children long term] we cannot know, but representation matters, diversity matters. And being able to dream and imagine oneself a chararcter, and to merely be entertained, is not a bad thing."

Perhaps most welcome are the recent remakes of the older classic Disney animations such as Aladdin and the upcoming Mulan. Earlier this month Disney announced it was casting R&B singer and actress Hall Bailey in the role of Areil in a live-action version of The Little Mermaid, a decision that drew a backlash from some fans, but was widely applauded.

"Disney's recasting of prior era's works is extremely impactful for children of colour and for global diversity," says Shearon Roberts, who is studying the changing face of Disney's social consciousness at Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans. "Disney's current decafe has offered girls the full spectrum to dream bryond castles and to imagine the full reach of their abilities.

"It is also a message for young boys. Women and girls are not just their objects of affection, but allies in ridding their worlds of evil and making the word better for all."

* Are we born leaders?

¡iHow your silblings - or lack of them - has shaped the skills you need at work.¡j By Christian Jarrett

Glen Allsopp first came up with the brilliant idea for his business sat in his childhood bedroom at home in Newcastle, aged 16. Its rapid success led him to relocate from the UK to Cape Town before he even reached adulthood.

But where does such striking entrepreneurial spirit come from? Genes, parenting and education all like play a role, but how does your family - especially your brothers and sisters - shape you?

Allsopp, the 30-year-old founder and CEO of detailed.com (an SEO consultancy that's worked with eight and nine-figure companies), is the youngest of three silbling, and he credits his position in the family with giving him the freedom to be creative and take risks.

"I could see my parents become more open to their kid doing different things as we all went from school and into the job market," he says. " I had total freedom to quit my part-time job, leave college and essentially start a new life on a different continent."

The idea that last-borns are more adventurous is just one of several theorie swirling around the research literature on how our position in the family affects us in ways that play out in our adult careers. An even more popular idea - an almost taken-for-granted fact - is that first-born children, with their years of exprience as top dog, are mort disposed to become leaders.

Yet the scientific evidence for this is weak at best - some experts even descrtbe the influence of birth order on personality as a "zombie theory", i.e. one that refuses to die despite being refuted.

But that doesn't mean our sibling relationships (or lack of them) have no impact. Recent findings suggest that instead it may be the age gap between siblings, the balance of bodys and girls, and quality of the dibling relationships thar matter more.

Those squabbles over who rides in the front of the car or who gets the latest bedtime may in fact be transformative. The battles and diplomacy of dibling life really can help equip us with the kinds of personal skills and attributes we'll find useful as working adults.

¡iBorn to lead?¡j

In terms of how siblings shape us, it's definitely our position in the family - birth order - that's the host topic. The internet is littered with dramatic articles claiming first-borns are more likely to become leaders.

Why wouldn't first-borns take those family boss skills and instincts forward into their working lives? There's plenty of anecdotal support for the idae too: European leaders Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, for instance, are both first-borns, as are the recent US Presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama (or raised as such - Obama had older half-siblings who he didn't live with). In the world of business, Sheryl Sandberg, Marissa Mayer, Jeff Bezoes, Elon Musk and Richard Branson, to name just a few famous CEOs, are all first-borns.

And yet several studies have deburnked the notion that birth order prtfoundly shapes our personalitiers. They analysed whether, for instance, we turn out more conscientious versus idle, or dominant versus timid.

In 2015, two huges  studies found no meaningful asso ciation between birth order and personality traits. In one, Rodica Damian and Brent Roberts at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign assessed the traits, IQ and birth order of nearly 400,000 US secondary-school students. In the other, Julia Rohrer at the University of Leipzig and her colleagues assessad IQ, personlity and birth-order data from nearly 20,000 people in the UK, US and Germany. In both studies there were some small correlations but they were minuscule in terms of their practical relevance.

Another popular idea related to brith order is that last-borns, like Allsopp, are more incline to take risks - yet this specific claim was also debunked when Tomas Lejarrage at the University of the Balearic Islands, together with colleagues, found no meaningful association between adventurousness and birth-order position.

¡iLiking your siblings helps¡j

So, birth order may not be all it's craked up to be. And yet watching a pair of siblings play and fight, argue and make friends again, it seems incredible to think that theses experiences would not leave their mark. One thing to bear in mind here is that birth order is only one aspect of sibling dynamics.

---------------------------------
108/12/13 Fri.

The lack of a first-born or last-born effect doesn't mean that your individual experience in the family hierarchy didn't shape the person you've become.

It may be the particular nature of your own relationships and role in the power structure that matter. But caution is again required - as Rohere points  out, if you find a link between sibling relationships and behavious later in life, there is a much simpler explanation: the stability of personality. "Somebody who takes care of their siblings might simply be a very caring person, and also act caring later in other environments; without any actual causal effect of sibling realtionships," she says.

Aside from these nuances, there is some evidence that sibling relations can have far-reaching psychological consequences. Above all, the quality of the sibling dynamic seems crucial - sibling can either cause or protect against mental health problems depending on whether there is warmth or conflict between them.

Earlier research found siblings who engaged in more pretend play together also tended to have a more precocious understanding of other people's emotions.

It's also worth remembering that brother and sister relationships do not exist in a vacuum - siblings tend to enjoy better relations where they are raised in a more orgainsed home environment with parents who are happy together. In other words, there's a nesting of effects - yes,your relationship with your sibling might have affected your own development, but in turn your dynamic with your siblings might have been shape by the broad atmosphere at home.

¡iThe power of one¡j

Being emotionally resilient, empathic and socially skilled are obvious advantages in many careers (as is being more of an extrovert, the resarch suggests having a sibling who you get along with may provide the perfect training ground. So where does that leave only children like me or Brendan Hufford, an SEO director at design agency Clique Studios? Hufford says the experience of being an only child influenced him deeply.

"I've noticed that I seek a lot of outside validation," he says. "Without sibling to validate my daily experiences growing up, I looked to others to proveide input on my work and daily events." He says that in his professional career, this has really helped him engage with collegues and build a rapport quickly. "However, as I moved into leadership positions, the number of colleagues that I moved into leadership positions, the number of colleagues that I moved into leadership positions, the number of colleagues that I could share openly with was reduced, leahding to long periods of ambivalence regarding my ability and effectiveness as a leader."

In terms of the research literature in this area, some of it is rather disconcerting: foe indtance a study that compared the personality traits and behavioural tendencies of people born in China just before or after it introduced its one-child policy found that those in the latter group - predominantly only children - tended to be "less trusting, less reustworthy, more risk-averse, less competitive, more pessimistic and less conscientious". Not a great profile for success navigating office politics later in life.

"I've had to work on learning to listen and give my teammates time to process things," says Hufford. "As a natural questioner, I've already thought through concepts very deeply before presenting them and, as an only child, I never had any competing interests other than convincing my parents of something. Compromise and communication was minimised to only what most affected me."

Another recent study reveal related results in terms of the possible social consequences of being an only child - participants who were only children scored lower for "agreeavleness" (they were less freindly and trusting). However, ther was a silver lining: the children in the study performed better in a test of their creativity, a finding that the researchers put down to their having received greater attention from their parents and/or the fact their parents expected more of them. (I would add that perhaps only children also benefit from more time spent alone with their imahination.)

That last result is tentative for now. But it suggests that, while I (and other only children) might wonder what it would have been like to have brother or sister to chat and play with, perhaps the quite I enjoyed at home helped lay the foundation for becoming a writer. After all, whatever our formative family experiences, there are many different occupational niches we may be able to flourish in.

¡iWelcome to the Family Values¡jBy Angela Henshall, 25th July 2019.

Welcome to Fanily Values, our fabulous new BBC Worklife series that explores all the mind-boggling trends shaping contemporary family life. Working parents particularly interest me; I'm a longtime journalist and editor, and parenthod has been the single biggest influence on my working life to date. But obviously juggling work with pareniing isn't the only topic we'll be covering.

The challenges of 21st Century life - everything from climate change to technology - are disrupting how we live and work. They also mean the way we think about family id changing, in some cases radically. What will unite thea Family Values content will be our approach: you can look forward to a series of longreads that use solutions-based reporting to explore the intricacies of our new "normal families", plus families (and family-like units) that break the mould.

The series will explore the tensions and opportunities around: how your parents shape your career, working with your family, character traits in kindergarten, our relationships with siblings, how different economies are preparing for the baby bust and a lot more, How will this picture of family values evolve in the next 20, 30 years?

We will also be endeavouring to get as much balance into our authorship and sourcing on these stories as possible. BBC Worklife participates in the 50:50 Project, which aims to increase the number of female contributors in our output. The 50:50 Project has become the BBC's biggest ever collective action on gender representation. We will also push to include other underrepresented perspectives, in terms of race, nationality, sexuality, and other identities.

Work and family can no longer be viewed in isolation. With Family Values, we'll be charting the present and future of the two biggest factors in many people's lives.

*The apps combatting'shareting'

¡iThe new tools share family snaps may pave the way for better social media. By Nicholas Mancall-Bitel, 14th Augst 2019.

We're all getting a little paranid about being spied on online but one group in particular is paying much closer attention than everyone else.

It's not Silicon Valley gury or young disruptors this timeo; it's doting parents and grandparents cooing over their toddlers.

Families everywhere are squabbling over how to share photos and messages involving children, who be too young to voice their own objections but whose involvement raeises the stakes of unthinking exposure.

"Sharenting", a portmanteau of parenting and sharing, isn't inherently good or bad depending on how and where parents

*The Science behind giving goods gifts

¡iResearch shows that giving a bad gift can hurt your relationships. So how can you be sure you pick something your recipient will love? By Tiffanie Wen, 10th December 2019.

It's the season to examine your holiday gift list. You'll have to figure out who gets a present - but also how much you're actually going to spend and, most importantly, what to get.

In the UK, the average household spends around 500 on gifts during the traditional holiday season, equalling Americans who spend about  $650. And although giving gifts can make you happy, communicate your fellings toward the receiver and even strengthen relationships, a less-than-stellar gift can have the opposite effect.

"Choosing the wrong gift anything in common," says Elizabeth Dunn, a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia Canada and co-author of Happy Money: The Science of Happier Spending. Her research has also showed that undesirable gift can sometimes negatively impact the receiver's perception of a relationship's future potential.

¡iSpending more does not always guarantee a well-received gift¡j

Since you don't want your holiday gift to cause more harm than good, how can you be sure to choose a gift the receiver will love? Psychology may have the answer. Don't fret about the price/

Should you just splurge to show how much you care?

Research has actually shown that spending more does not always guarantee a well-receives gift. One study found that the more expensive a gift, the more gives expected recipients to appreciate it. But while givers thought spending more conveyed more thoughtfulness, receivers didn't associate the price with their level of apperciation.

"It seems pretty intuitive that if you spend more, you're going to get a better gift. It turns out that there's no evidence that recipients are sensitive to the cost of a gift when they figure out how much they're going to enjoy that gift," says Jeff Galak, an associate professor of marketing at the Carnegie Mellon Tepper School of Business in the US city of Pittsbutgh.

Galak, who studies consumer behaviour and decision making, acknowledges that you may have to hit certain price threshould due to tradition or expectations. But once you may have to hit a certain price threshold due to tradition or expectations. But once you meet that cost, "it doesn't matter if you buy something more valuable", he says. The gift itself is what matters most.

Think longer term

Galak says the trick for giving a great gift is to think past the fleeting moment of actually handing it over, a concept he and colleagues Julian Givi and Elanor Williams found to be a common theme in studies on gift giving, including a paper they authored.

"When givers give gift, they're trying to optimise on the moment they give the gift and see the smile on the recipient's face right in that moment," says Galak. "But what recipients care about is how much value they're going to derive from that over a longer time period."

¡iIf you have something in common with somebody, get something that shares the same affinity - Elizabeth Dunn¡j

In other words, it might not be exciting to watch a friend or family member open the gift of a movie-streaming subscription, so you might be less likely to give one. But a recipent may actually love it, since it's a gift that can be enjoyed often over time.

Forget about uniqueness

Galak also suggests not getting hung up on giving the most unique gift out there. Sometimes something that many people desire or may others have can be exactly what someone wants.

One study showed that we tend to focus on a recipient's unique traits and personality as we shop for them. But this hyper-specificity leads us to ignore other aspects of thir wants and needs, which may make us buy them an inferior gift. We also tend to want to buy  different gifts for multiple people, even if they might all br happier with the same thing-and might never compare gifts at all.

In order to feel like a good gift giver, people erroneously feel like they need to diversify the gift, even at the cost of giving the best present, according to Galak. You might also overlook buying something that you own because you don't want to undermine your own sense of individuality.

So those trainers of yours thatr your friend loves? Don't avoid gifting a matching pair just because you want to be unique.

Buy based on share interests

To shop better, psychology professor Dunn suggests starting with something you have in common with the recipient. She says that instead of using you and the recipient diverge, focus on what you share and pick a gift from there.

"People are better at chossing something for themselves, "she says, "so if you have something in common with somebody, get something that shares the same affinity, because something you would like will more likely be something they like."

Asking somebody what they want is seen as taboo. And that's a shame. We would all be better off if we gave people what they want - Jeff Galak

For an even stronger gift think about a common interest you share and buy something that your recipient can experience - say, concert tickets or a cooking class. Research has also showen that experiential gifts can bring you and the recipient closer, even if you don't experience the gift with your recipient.

Ask them what they want

If you have nothing in common, though, Dunn recommends just asking the recipient what they want, or to work off a registry. In fact, research shows that people are more appreciative of gifts they ask for than ones they don't.

"People want to be creative and surprise the recipient," says Dunn, "but the better gift will be whatever it is thet say they want."

Galak agress that the simplest way to make a person happy with a gift is asking them what they want. It's not an answer most people like, he says, because good gifts are supposed to be a 'surprise' - even though science has disprovent this.
