* Two drivers of learning behaviour are natural curiosity and the desire for a reward. But which is better for helping children learn? By Tiffanie Wen, 6th December 2019.

Getting children to learn for the sake of learning rarher than the promise of an A grade or threat of an F. It sounds like a pipe dream, right? Maybe not.

From the time they are toddles, children are naturally interested in exploring their enviornment. From examining a blade of grass to playing with the family pet, toddlers want to know how enerything works, feels and tastes. According to experts, it's not until later they learn to do something - like site quietly at a snake table - in order to gain a reward or avoid a punishment.

These two drivers of behaviour are knowns as intrinsic motivation (natural curiosity) extrinsic motivation (link to reward). But which is better for helping children learn - and can you nuture a joy of learning without handing out rewards?

¡iThe value of natural curiosity¡j 

"Intrinsic motivation starts early. Chuldren are proactive. They are curious by nature," says professor Frederic Guay, an expert in motivation t Laval University in Quebec. "Educators and school system need to nuture this motivation."

Guay and his colleagues conducted a soon-to-be published meta- analysis on intrinsic motivation and student outcomes from primary school to university level, looking at 344 studies and a sample of more than 200,000 children. Student completed a questionnaire designed to measure different types of motivation, and grades were swlf-reported or taken from in particular subjects experienced higher achivment, increased persistence and increased creativity in those areas.

Other research backs up the notion that intrinsically motivated kids are better at learning. One study from Germany found that students aged seven to nine who felt immersed in the stories they read had higher levels of reading comprehension than those who were driven by the desire to compete with other student. Another German study found a reciprocal relationship between intrinsic reading motivaion and reading achievement in students aged eight to 10, but no such relationship when the motivation was extrinsic.

And the bevefits of intrinsic motivation on performance are not limited to kids. One study that examined the motivations of cadets at West Point military academy found that those who were purely intrinsically motivated were more likely to become commissioned officers, extend their service and be selected for early promotions than those who were both intrinsically motivated.

¡iSo why do we give stickers, then?¡j 

Yet despite the evidence on the importance of nuturing intrinsic motivation, a reward culture creeps into the classroom early on. Children get prize like stickers to encourage good behaviour and regular report cards to offically acknowledge achievment.


* Acknowledging one student's good behaviour helps other student do the same - Christine Dewart

One study of teacher's use of rewards from kindergarten to fifth grade found, for example, that all teachers in the study used rewards like praise. Nearly 80% also used tangible rewards on a weekly basis, like tokens to purchase prizes later. Other common forms of reward included class privileges, like deciding an activity or extra time on fun activities.

Christine Dewart, who has taught five-to-six-year-olds in Califorina for nine years, says when she studied child development at university there was an emphasis on the importance of intrinsic motivation and avoiding too many rewards. But in here everyday professional experience, she sees the value of using rewards to manage her class - and has found that "acknowleding one studenrt's good behaviour helps other student do the same."

Dewart cites the case of a student with anxiety and physical aggression issue. "I didn't want to single him out for misbehaving, so I came up with a behaviour plane involving rewards. For every 15 minutes he was able to control himself, he earned one minute of free times to use later. "The 15-minute requirement then became 30 minutes and eventually stretched to an entire lesson in which he was able to stay calm and attaentive-a process jumpstarted by the reward.

¡iCan you boost intrinsic motivation?¡j

If educating children is a complex mix of nuturing their own curiosity and rewarding them for completing less attractives tasks, can we do more to mask the task itself the reward?

Sarah McGeown, a senior lecturer in developmental psychology at the University of Edinburgh, says there are things teachers and parents can do th boost a child's intrinsic motivation. One example is recreational reading, of which intrinsic reading motivation is a predictor.

She says finding books that are at the right reading level is important, as is encouraging student to identify as readers even of they choose comic books or magazines over novels. "It's about broadening the conceptualisation of what it means to be a reader so more children and adolescents can self-identify as readers," she says. " Helping children find the geners or authors that they enjouy is really important."

Guay believes it is essential to support kids in a way that makes them feel they have chioces and are doing things of their own free will. "Rather than focusing on rewards, focus on the quality of relationshiop with the students," he says, "[That} means listening to children and even acknowledging negative feeling, which are normal."

* Studies have shown that for older student, extrinsic motivators can boost performanc

He suggests finding time to address negative feelings toward an activity and explain why it is valuable even if it's not particularly fun. "Students who find learning important, even if they don't enjoy it will bring about the same kinds of positive outcomes as you see with those with high intrinsic motivation."

¡iDoes feedback trump grades?¡j

But what does this all mean for grades, perhaps the most obvious extrinsic motivator for school learners? Both Guay and McGeown say there should be less focus on grades and more on the effort it took durning the process itself. But some teachers want to go further.

Aaron Blackwelder, a high school English teacher, helped found the Facebook group Teachers Going Gradeless three years ago. From an intial membership of a few hundred, it now has 5,000 members.

He was inspired by a serious of studies in the 1980s in which students aged 10-12 were assigned to receive either grades, grades and feeback, or feedback only. Interest and performance were highest for students who only received feedback, while grades and grades plus feedback undermined their interest and performance, the studies found.

Instead of giving grades, Blackwelder presents students with a list of skills they need to master and opts for a pure feedback model on assignments. Some teachers are leerly of his methods but he believes they are working. While there are always a few kids who don't participate, that number hasn't gone up, while the kids who do participate are improving "astronomically".

"They trust me to offer constructive feedback because my actions are not perceived as punitive," he says. "Student trust one another as there is no competition to earn the most points and earn the highest grade in the class. Rather, student rely on one another's strengths in order to be successful."

Blackwelder, despite his preferred model, is still required to given a grade at the end of term. But Adam Tyner, associate director of research at the Thomans B.Fordham Institute, an education reform think tank, says grades do serve a practical purpose.

"The main benefit of using grades is that it distills performance into a singele value that parents and student should be able to understand. Teachers can include both academic performance outcomes and day-to-day behaviour into students' grades, which means that they can theoretically capture not just whethere the student knows the subject but also 'non-cognitive skill's like how well students cooperate and collaborate."

And the fact that teachers who have adopted a feedback-only model in the classroom still need to report a final grade points to a social reality, that as we grow op and enter the job market extrinsic motivation - probably in the form of salaries - will play a greater role in our lives.

¡iA place for rewardws?¡j

That may partly be why studies have shown that for older students, extrinsic motivators can boost performance.

Tyner points to the National Math and Science Initiative's College Readiness Program in the US, which couples advanced training for high school students with financial incentives for successful students and teachers. "A rigorous evaluation by Northwest University economist Kirabo Jackson found that NMSI programme increases college attendance by 4.2 percentage points while increasig college readiness and longer-term labour force outcomes. Some subgroup effects were jaw-dopping. Hispanic student experienced an 11% gain in earnings when exposed to the NMSI incentive programme."

¡i I'm sceptical for most adolescent schoolwork...there is much student intrinsic motivation we need to worry about undermining - Adam Tyner¡j

Tyner adds that although extrinsic motivators may undermine existing existing high intrinsic motivation, it is not always the case, and kids are not always intrinsically motivated to begin with.

"One point that researchers make is that extrinsic motivators may be dangerous when intrinsic motivation is already really high and a new incentive re-frames the experience as something to get paid for rather than something to do for fun," he says. "I'm sceptical that for most adolescent much student intrinsic motivation we need to worry about undermining."

And both motivators can soupport each other. "There is a myth that intrinsic and extrinsic motivation are part of some kind of zero-sum competition. If an extrinsic motivator can indirectly empower students."

* Did Disney shape how you see the world?

¡iThere's a good chance that some of your beliefs have been influenced by decades of animated movies. By Richard Gray, 1st August 2019.

Do you whistle while you work? Perhaps you prefer to just keep swimming. Or maybe you're trying to fit you phenomenal cosmic powers into an itty, bitty living space.

If any of these phrases are now worming their way out of your consciousness (you're welcome), then it is likely you are a child of Disney, brought up on regular diet of chirpy tales to keep you occupied while your parents grabbed an hour for themselves.

The generation now filling up workplaces were fed a feast of feature-length animations during their formative years like no other before them.

The Little Mermaid came out 30 years ago and less than six months later was released on home video. This was a significant break for Disney, who usually waited several years before releasing movies on VHS. The films that followed through the 1990s - including Beauty and the Beast, then Aladdin, the Lion King, Pocahontas and the first two Tony Story movies - also came out on video around a year after their cinema release.

And then came DVDs. Disney's first animated DVD was a re- release of The Little Mermaid in 1999. DVDs didn't need rewinding and were less susceptible to going wonky after being repeatedly watched. They were the perfect "electronic babysitter".

But has Disney's cocktail of morality, stereotypes and a sprinkling of magic had any lasting lasting impact on this generation of adults who ,once upon a time, devoured these films as children? And could it be influencing how your colleagues behave in the workplace or even your future career?

"Disney is quite pervasive within our modern culture," says Martyn Giffin, an expert on the cultural perception of work and organisation at Durham University in the UK. "Home videos exposed kids over and over again to the ideas in Disney films. If they were doing this from a young age it is bound to have an impact."

At face value, these cartoons are harmless entertainment, but some researchers have raised comcerns about the subliminal lessons Disney's films contain. Perhaps the most common criticism is the way these have portrayed gender, racial and cultural stereotypes in the past. The opening song Arabian Nights in Aladdin, for example, contained the line "where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face" when it was released in 1993. Disney later changed the lyric.

¡iLasting ompact of stereotypes¡j

Some researchers divide the corporation'ds portrayal of women into distinct eras. First came the domestic era, when female characters like Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella were portrayed as homemakers, often cleaning and in need of rescue by a man.

Then came the rebellious, new-age phase of Ariel in The Little Mermaid, Princess Jasmine inAladdin, Pocahontas and Mulan. During this period, Disney's women seemed to gain a more independent streak, strivng to free themselves form the bonds of society. But Ariel also sacrifices her voice in order to be with man she loves.

"The symbolism here is powerful," wrote Mia Adessa Towbein and her colleagues at the family studies department of Colorado State University in one study. "To win the love of the prince, she most forfeit her thoughts and intellect, her independence and identity."

Although the story was originallu written by Hams Christian Andersen, the researchers say it provides an apt metaphor for many of Disney's heroines - "no one listens to their words".

The Little Mermaid and the fives subsequent fioms also show another trend - the female characters start to sperk less. Despite being the title characters, women speak just 32% of the time in The Little Mermaid, while they have just 24% of lines in Pocahontas and 23% in Mulan, In Aladdin, female characters have just 10% the dialogue.

Carmen Fought and Karen Eisenhauer, the linguists at North Carolina State University whose analysis produced these figures, also found male characters in the same films tended to boss the female characters around far more than vice versa. When the women did so, they were more polite than the men. Others have suggested levels of uncertainty in the dialogue of female characeters have also increased.

For critics, this sends a strong message to young children that reinforces many long- standing gender stereotypes. And there is some evidence it could leave a lasting impression.

---------------------------------
108/12/11 Wed.

A study by family life researcher Sarash Coyne at Brigham Young University - inspired by concerns about her daughter's own consumption of Disney - found that engagemenyt with Disney princesses in young girls around two years old was associated with Disney princesses in young girls around two years old was associated Disney princesses in young girls around two years old was associated with greater female fender-stereotype behavious and lower body self-esteem a year later.

¡iDemonising the mentally ill¡j

Disney has also faced criticism over treatment of mental health - 85% of Disney's 34 animated featyres released before 2004 contained references to mental illness, often in ways that aimed to denigrate or set apart characters, according to psychology researchers at the University of Calgary. They warned it could have "implications  for child viewers in terms of their potentially learning prejudicial attitudes" against people perceived as having mental health problems.

The same research team also warned that the high prevalence of referevces to evil in Disney's films could also lead children to learn to "demonies people who engage in perceived 'bad' behaviours" of they watch the films repeatedly.

It is something Fred Zimmerman, a behavioural economist at the University of California, Los Angeles, agrees could be contributing to wider societal problems today.

"Disney films almost always present a battle between Good and Evil," he says. "ONe can't help but wonder of this Disnified understanding of the world as a struggle between the good guys and bad guys is a piece of today's problems of political polarisation and social exclusion."

¡iThe hidden upside¡j

But there are many potential positive effects from Disney's films too. ONe study showed that watching Disney characters help one another - a common thread - inspired children to help their own friends. 

Another study by Coyne revealed that Disney films are rich in so called "prosocial" behaviour, such as sharing, helping others, or offering compliments or encouragement. She and her colleagues fount that Disney's films contain an average of one act of prosocial behavious every minute - about seven times the level found in other children's television programming in the US.

Griffin believe that the messages learned by children at a young age from films can be carried into the workplace and that there is a good chance that someone sitting near you in the office has some of their beliefs shaped by Disney.

He has studied how work is portrayed in Disney films and says it may have contributed to the reluctance amomg the younger workforce to join traditional workplaces. Millennials demand far more flexibility from employears than previous generations, are more willing to change jobs and companies and often prefer self-employment to the constraints of full-time contracts.

"In the early films, work was always portrayed as this horrible bad thinh," says Griffin. "You had characters who often separated from their parents and punished in this world of work, like Snow White filling up the wash bucket and slaving away in the house and Cinderella subjected to work in the household."

"Disney's response was to say 'whistle while you work' and everythig will be ok as a prince will come along and rescue you," he says. "That went on in the films for years."

"If you think about that [situation] in a modern workplace, it is a dangeruos view to have - if you just carry on being exploited because you think everything is going to turn out to be okay."

Managers - think about the ugly stepsisters in Cinderella for example - are also typically portrayed as manipulative and horrible.

It might also explain some of the dissatisfaction thar millennials who were children during the late 1990s habe with work, he says.

Disney itself did not respond to repeated BBC requests for an interview or a comment for this article. But in Disney's recent films many researchers have noticed a marked change. Giffin, for example, says carrer are portrayed more positively and as something to aspire to.

"Zootopia is great example of work in Disney films," says Griffin. "There ie a bunny rabbit who wants to be a police officer and she gets laughed at but throughout the films she sets out to prove herself. The newest films also have this idea of bringing your friends closer to you to help change your identity and your workplace. That's a really positive message."

The female characters in Frozen, Brave and Moana also represent a new, independent and free-spirited era of Disney. They are strong and in control of their own lives and no longer need male characters to save the day. But while Brave and Moana are seen as truly breaking the Disney princess mould, opinion is somewhat divided over Frozen's heroines.

"The company is attempting to keep up with the times with reference to gender equality and representation," says Ingvild Kvale Sorenssen, who studies children's relationships with Disney at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. "How this influences [children long term] we cannot know, but representation matters, diversity matters. And being able to dream and imagine oneself a chararcter, and to merely be entertained, is not a bad thing."

Perhaps most welcome are the recent remakes of the older classic Disney animations such as Aladdin and the upcoming Mulan. Earlier this month Disney announced it was casting R&B singer and actress Hall Bailey in the role of Areil in a live-action version of The Little Mermaid, a decision that drew a backlash from some fans, but was widely applauded.

"Disney's recasting of prior era's works is extremely impactful for children of colour and for global diversity," says Shearon Roberts, who is studying the changing face of Disney's social consciousness at Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans. "Disney's current decafe has offered girls the full spectrum to dream bryond castles and to imagine the full reach of their abilities.

"It is also a message for young boys. Women and girls are not just their objects of affection, but allies in ridding their worlds of evil and making the word better for all."

* Are we born leaders?

¡iHow your silblings - or lack of them - has shaped the skills you need at work.¡j By Christian Jarrett

Glen Allsopp first came up with the brilliant idea for his business sat in his childhood bedroom at home in Newcastle, aged 16. Its rapid success led him to relocate from the UK to Cape Town before he even reached adulthood.

But where does such striking entrepreneurial spirit come from? Genes, parenting and education all like play a role, but how does your family - especially your brothers and sisters - shape you?

Allsopp, the 30-year-old founder and CEO of detailed.com (an SEO consultancy that's worked with eight and nine-figure companies), is the youngest of three silbling, and he credits his position in the family with giving him the freedom to be creative and take risks.

"I could see my parents become more open to their kid doing different things as we all went from school and into the job market," he says. " I had total freedom to quit my part-time job, leave college and essentially start a new life on a different continent."

The idea that last-borns are more adventurous is just one of several theorie swirling around the research literature on how our position in the family affects us in ways that play out in our adult careers. An even more popular idea - an almost taken-for-granted fact - is that first-born children, with their years of exprience as top dog, are mort disposed to become leaders.

Yet the scientific evidence for this is weak at best - some experts even descrtbe the influence of birth order on personality as a "zombie theory", i.e. one that refuses to die despite being refuted.

But that doesn't mean our sibling relationships (or lack of them) have no impact. Recent findings suggest that instead it may be the age gap between siblings, the balance of bodys and girls, and quality of the dibling relationships thar matter more.

Those squabbles over who rides in the front of the car or who gets the latest bedtime may in fact be transformative. The battles and diplomacy of dibling life really can help equip us with the kinds of personal skills and attributes we'll find useful as working adults.

¡iBorn to lead?¡j

In terms of how siblings shape us, it's definitely our position in the family - birth order - that's the host topic. The internet is littered with dramatic articles claiming first-borns are more likely to become leaders.

Why wouldn't first-borns take those family boss skills and instincts forward into their working lives? There's plenty of anecdotal support for the idae too: European leaders Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, for instance, are both first-borns, as are the recent US Presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama (or raised as such - Obama had older half-siblings who he didn't live with). In the world of business, Sheryl Sandberg, Marissa Mayer, Jeff Bezoes, Elon Musk and Richard Branson, to name just a few famous CEOs, are all first-borns.

And yet several studies have deburnked the notion that birth order prtfoundly shapes our personalitiers. They analysed whether, for instance, we turn out more conscientious versus idle, or dominant versus timid.

In 2015, two huges  studies found no meaningful asso ciation between birth order and personality traits. In one, Rodica Damian and Brent Roberts at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign assessed the traits, IQ and birth order of nearly 400,000 US secondary-school students. In the other, Julia Rohrer at the University of Leipzig and her colleagues assessad IQ, personlity and birth-order data from nearly 20,000 people in the UK, US and Germany. In both studies there were some small correlations but they were minuscule in terms of their practical relevance.

Another popular idea related to brith order is that last-borns, like Allsopp, are more incline to take risks - yet this specific claim was also debunked when Tomas Lejarrage at the University of the Balearic Islands, together with colleagues, found no meaningful association between adventurousness and birth-order position.

¡iLinking your siblings helps¡j

So, brith order may not be all it's craked up to be. And yet watching a pair of siblings play and fight, argue and make friends again, it seems incredible to think that theses experiences would not leave their mark. One thing to bear in mind here is that birth order is only one aspect of sibling dynamics.
